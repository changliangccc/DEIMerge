Q\n\nExplanation of Each Code Span's Relevance to the Issue:\n\n1. **Combinable.__or__**: This span defines the `__or__` method for objects that are conditionally combinable using the `|` operator. Since `Q` objects are meant to use this operator, the malfunction specifically surfaces when dealing with non-pickleable types in combinations.\n\n2. **QuerySet.__or__**: Relevant to combining different querysets using the `|` operator. This span shows how two querysets are logically unioned, potentially involving `Q` objects recreated or manipulated within this method.\n\n3. **Q._combine**: Concerns the method `_combine`, invoked internally when two `Q` objects are to be combined using a logical `OR`. This method verifies if the objects to combine are indeed `Q` and not an empty set, providing insight into why type errors arise.\n\n4. **Q.__or__**: Directly connects to the `|` logical operator implementation for `Q` objects, leveraging `_combine` for effects so that faulty handling from `_combine` permeates here, leading to distinct operational flaws highlighted in the issue.\n\n5. **Q**: Defines the `Q` class itself, within which problematic dict handling causing `|` operations flaw rests, is here, flagging attributes and mechanism intrinsic to faulty illustrating serialization setup that calls the error.\n",

Ensuring that `returning_fields` are appropriately appended in the conflict update scenario involves this method.\n\n6. **SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql**:\n   This method executes the constructed SQL insert query. It needs adjustments to safely run SQL with `returning_fields` and handle scenarios with conflict updates.\n",
        "patch_exp": "\n1. **Hunk 1 (query.py mm 1809-1816)**:\n    The code change adds a comment for contextual clarity but doesn't make a substantial change to achieve the requirement of retaining `returning_fields` under the conflict conditions.\n\n2. **Hunk 2 (query.py mm 1834-1850)**:\n    This hunk modifies the condition to check not only the existing `bulk_return` and `on_conflict` is `None` but now also includes a check for `UPDATE` type conflicts. This logic extends the application to execute inserts with `returning_fields` attributes populated when updating rows causing conflicts.\n",

        "issue_exp": "\nThe issue involves the `bulk_create` method in Django's queryset. When the method has the `update_conflicts` flag set, it doesn't return primary keys (IDs) of the affected rows as expected. The suggestion is to modify the query generation so that the return clause includes `returning my_model.id`, ensuring that updated rows have their IDs returned correctly.\n",
        "code_span_exp": "\n1. `DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql`: This code span is responsible for generating the SQL clause for handling conflicts (`IGNORE`, `UPDATE`). This affects whether fields like IDs are returned or not.\n2. `QuerySet.bulk_create`: This is the method where `update_conflicts` might omit returning the IDs after conflict resolution, the core of the issue.\n3. `QuerySet._batched_insert`: This helper method batch-inserts the provided objects; relevant as it calls `_insert`, which might omit returning IDs depending on `on_conflict`.\n4. `QuerySet._insert`: Handles insertion of new records and interacts closely with `query.get_compiler(using=using).execute_sql(returning_fields)`, which should return IDs when `update_conflicts` is set.\n5. `SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql`: Builds SQL query strings including returning fields. Relevant to ensuring the RETURNING clause is included properly.\n6. `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql`: Executes the final SQL command and manages returning_rows from bulk inserts or conflict updates, making it relevant to check if IDs are returned as expected.\n",
        "patch_exp": "\n1. **Hunk in `django/db/models/query.py` at line 1808**:\n   - Added a comment to ensure `returning_fields` are included in the SQL execution step.\n   \n2. **Hunk in `django/db/models/query.py` at line 1833**:\n   - Modified the condition inside `_batched_insert` to consider `on_conflict` being `OnConflict.UPDATE`. This ensures that IDs are returned when updating conflicts.\n",
        "new_issues_exp": "\nNo new direct issues are introduced by the patch. However, ensure that the `on_conflict` checks correctly align with how other SQL backends handle conflict resolution, as the change assumes a PostgreSQL-like behavior for returning IDs.\n"
