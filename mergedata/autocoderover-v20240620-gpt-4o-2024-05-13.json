        "issue_exp": "\nThe issue is with the `bulk_create` method in Django's QuerySet, particularly when handling conflicts during bulk insert operations. Currently, when conflicts are handled using the `update_conflicts` flag, the primary keys (IDs) for the affected rows are not returned in the resulting queryset. This behavior is acceptable for `ignore_conflicts` due to PostgreSQL's limitations, but with `update_conflicts`, the expectation is to receive the IDs for updated rows. The patch aims to fix this by appending the `RETURNING id` clause to the query when `update_conflicts` is used.\n",

Currently, the generated SQL query lacks the RETURNING clause when an on_conflict statement is present but does not handle the case when conflicts are resolved through updates (update_conflicts).
